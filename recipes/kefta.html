    <h3>Yummy Meatballs Like Never Before</h3>

    <p>
      This simple meatball dish is delicious, rich, and fresh. It was taught to
      me by my Algerian husband, one of his favorites from home. The tomato
      sauce can be used for anything and the amounts of flavors can be adjusted.
      I like a lot of garlic and pepper. I have also found halal hamburger to be
      much leaner and lighter than regular. You can find it at international
      food stores and halal butcher shops in bigger cities. Serve this dish with
      a French baguette.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Combine the ground beef with half of the minced garlic and a
          tablespoon of chopped onion. Mix with your hands until fully
          incorporated. Shape the meat mixture into 1 1/2-inch oblong patties;
          you should have 12 to 14 meatballs.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the patties in batches
          until they are crispy on both sides and are no longer pink in the
          center, about 10 minutes. Set the meatballs aside in a rimmed serving
          dish and repeat with the remaining patties.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the remaining chopped onion. Add
          salt and pepper. Cook the onions in the drippings, stirring
          constantly, until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about
          5 minutes. Stir in the remaining half of the garlic and cook for 30
          seconds.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Stir in the roma tomatoes, dried parsley, ras el hanout, and water.
          Cook until the tomatoes are soft, about 5 minutes. Pour the tomato
          sauce over the meatballs and serve.
        </p>
